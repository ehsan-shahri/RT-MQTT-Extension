The presented system proposes a set of extensions to the MQTT protocol grounded on Software Defined Networking (SDN) that enable, at the network level, attaining real-time communication services. This system conveys real-time requirements such as deadline, transmission bandwidth, and flow priority to topics and end-nodes by standard MQTT messages via the user properties field and then they are used to improve the timeliness of the execution of software components at the broker and to manage the network using real-time network manager (RT-NM), creating deterministic communication channels matching the real-time requirements of the associated topics.
